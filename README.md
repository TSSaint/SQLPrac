# SQLPrac

A repo wherein I am refreshing my knowledge of SQL and querying.

Querying in SQL is powerful and relatively flexible. It also leaves data untouched, which allows for data to be parsed in many different ways.

There are two important components in SQL databases:
1) Data - information
2) Schema - establishes how information should be stored/divided and relates to others. These are called "tables".

Typically, tables are similar to spreadsheets with rows and columns.
Often or not, data is stored individually.

Rows are defined individually. Rows can be manipulated and parsed at will, allowing for flexible querying.

ex.
Product | Size | Quantity
Shirt      M        1      
Cap        M        2
Shoes      11       3
